#  Fraud Detection System with Streamlit

This project is a **Fraud Detection Web Application** built using **Python + Streamlit**. It provides an interactive interface to analyze data and detect potentially fraudulent records using a machine learning model or rule-based logic.

The application runs locally using Streamlit and allows users to query and explore suspicious records through a browser interface.

---

##  Features

* Easy-to-use **Streamlit UI**
* Detect fraud patterns dynamically
* Real-time browser-based interface
* Supports integration with ML models / RAG / rule engines
* Local deployment on any machine
* Clean and modular Python structure
